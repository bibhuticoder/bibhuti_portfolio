## Water jar for normal tap

- Pull the part of the cap that has been teared.
- At last, when the part being pulled is coming off, apply more force and the cap will come out.
- Pour 25% of water in the vessel. This makes the base strong and minimizes the chance of falling down of the whole structure.
- Bend the jar completely into the vessel.

## Water jar for dispenser

- Dispenser has a pointed tip through which water flows into it. Also, it has very little space for handling the overflow of water from jar.
- So we cut on the inner circle of the Jar's cap.
- And gently bend it into the dispenser. Few mls of water will flow out but dispenser's cavity will be able to handle it.
