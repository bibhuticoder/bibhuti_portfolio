### Note
You don't need any cutting materials.

### Steps
- ‌Face the sack towards you.
- ‌Notice the thread on left/right side. It has a simple knot like structure.
- ‌Identify the opening thread of that knot and pull.
- ‌There are generally two stiches. Open both of them.

### Tip
If you don't find the knot on left side and it feels like it needs to be cut. Most probably either you are on wrong side or the position of knot has been shifed in reverse.
