This article will demonstrate how Instagram can be integrated with your system. Specifically, it explores a mechanism to show **usersâ€™ Instagram posts on your app/website**.

> At time of writing this article, [instafeed.js](https://instafeedjs.com/#/) provides similar functionality. However, it depends on Herokuâ€™s free service to refresh tokens. After Heroku updated its pricing policy, it kind of became expensive. This approach serves as self-hosted alternative.

Before going further, please head over to [Facebook Developers](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-basic-display-api/overview) page and go through the **overview**. It will be easier to grasp concepts further.

The overall process boils down to 4 steps:

1. Create a Facebook app
2. Get access tokens
3. Setup token refresh service
4. Fetch Data
   
## 1. Create a Facebook App

Follow steps 1 to 3 from this link.

[https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-basic-display-api/getting-started](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-basic-display-api/getting-started)

## 2. Get Access Tokens
Proceeding further requires app-specific keys and secrets which can be found here.

App ID is required on the frontend only; backend requires both ID & secret. Since App secret canâ€™t be shown to users, itâ€™s kept as an environment variable on the server.

<g-image src="https://miro.medium.com/max/560/1*JAs5NfA91Yg_aeBcfGjAeA.png" />

Also, add your frontend applicationâ€™s URL to Valid OAuth Redirect URIs. localhost with https will work. Hosting static app on [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) will do and is a better option.

### Frontend

Use this piece of code on a static frontend site to get a short-lived access token. Short-lived access tokens are valid for 1 hour but can be exchanged for long-lived tokens (will do later on server-side).

Since our goal is to fetch user-related info and their Instagram photos, scopes are set to `user_profile` & `user_media`.

```javascript
// Invoke this function on button click or whatever other use case
function setupInsta(){
	let appId = "XXXXXXXXXXXXXX";
	let redUri = window.location.origin + "/insta";
	let url = `https://api.instagram.com/oauth/authorize?client_id=${appId}&redirect_uri=${redUri}&scope=user_profile,user_media&response_type=code`;
	window.open(url, "_blank").focus();
}
```

It will open authorization window on a new tab. After being authorized it will redirect to` /insta` page(as configured on the above code) with a query parameter containing `code`. That code will be used to fetch short-lived access token on the backend.

Next, the `code` & `redirect URI` are sent to the server for further processing.

### Backend

Itâ€™s assumed that the backend has an endpoint for receiving `code` & `redirect URI` via any HTTP method.

Now, the next step is to get Short-Lived-Access-Token. The code is self-explanatory.

> JSON-based POST wonâ€™t work. So form based request is sent via request.

```javascript
// data from frontend
let code = req.body.code;
let redirectUri = req.body.redirectUri;

let accessToken = null;
try {

    // send form based request to Instagram API
    let result = await request.post({
        url: 'https://api.instagram.com/oauth/access_token',
        form: {
            client_id: process.env.INSTA_APP_ID,
            client_secret: process.env.INSTA_APP_SECRET,
            grant_type: 'authorization_code',
            redirect_uri: req.body.redirectUri,
            code: req.body.code
        }
    });

    // Got access token. Parse string response to JSON
    accessToken = JSON.parse(result).access_token;
} catch (e) {
    console.log("Error=====", e);
}
```

After **Short-Lived-Access-Token** is obtained, it needs to be exchanged with **Long-Lived-Access-Token**.

```javascript
  try {
    let resp = await axios.get(`https://graph.instagram.com/access_token?grant_type=ig_exchange_token&client_secret=${process.env.INSTA_APP_SECRET}&access_token=${accessToken}`)
    accessToken = resp.data.access_token;
    // save accessToken  to Database
  } catch (e) {
    console.log("Error=====", e.data);
  }
```

For further API calls only the **Long-Lived-Access-Token** is used. As mentioned earlier, short-lived token has 1 hour validity. Similarly long-lived token has 60 days validity. i.e. the token just stored on DB needs to be refreshed before it expires.

## 3. Setup Token Refresh Service

To refresh token every 60 days, a cron job seems suitable. [node-cron](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-cron) will serve best for this purpose.

```javascript
import cron from 'node-cron';
import instaRefreshCron from "./crons/instaRefresh.cron";

// run immediately after server starts
instaRefreshCron();

// refresh instaAccessToken eg: weekly(every Sat)
cron.schedule('* * * * * 7', async () => {
    await instaRefreshCron();
});
```

Inside `instaRefresh.cron` file, it gets old token from DB and replaces it with new one.

```javascript
try {
    let oldAccessToken =  "XXXXX"; // get from DB
    let resp = await axios.get(`https://graph.instagram.com/refresh_access_token?grant_type=ig_refresh_token&access_token=${oldAccessToken}`)
    if (resp.data.access_token) {
        let newAccessToken = resp.data.access_token;
        // save newAccessToken to DB
    }
} catch (e) {
    console.log("Error=====", e.response.data);
}
```

Hence, this cron job will automatically refresh access tokens.


## 4. Fetch data

Finally, its time to fetch data from Instagram. We will be making use of the 
` stored on DB. To learn more on what kinds of data can be fetched, visit this [page](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-basic-display-api/guides).

> Access tokens are app-scoped (unique to the app and user pair)

Here, we will be fetching media uploaded by user. Then Filter it and obtain images only.

```javascript
try {
  let instaAccessToken = "XXXXXX"; // get from DB
  let resp = await axios.get(`https://graph.instagram.com/me/media?fields=media_type,permalink,media_url&access_token=${instaAccessToken}`);
  resp = resp.data;
  let instaPhotos = resp.data.filter(d => d.media_type === "IMAGE").map(d => d.media_url);
  // Got insta photos
} catch (e) {
   console.log(e.response.data.error);
}
```

## Platform Rate Limits

Instagram API has limit on number of API calls. More details can be found [here](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/overview/rate-limiting#platform-rate-limits).

One way around this issue is to cache API responses. For this particular scenario, the image URLs can be saved to database every, let's say, every 3 hours; using cron-jobs.

```javascript
import cron from 'node-cron';
import instaCacheCron from "./crons/instaCache.cron";

// run immediately after server starts
instaCacheCron();

// update instaPhotos Cache every 3 hours
cron.schedule('0 0 */3 * * *', async () => {
  // this method fetches updated Insta images and saves to DB.
	await instaCacheCron();
});
```

Instead of calling Instagram API directly, images can be served from DB; as a cache. However, this particular case may not be feasible for every use case.

I hope this guide will help to integrate Instagram Basic API on Node.js-based applications. If you have a more robust alternative, please mention in the comments below.
