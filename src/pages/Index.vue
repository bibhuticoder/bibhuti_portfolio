    <h1>Notebook</h1>

    <p>
      This platform serves as a notebook.

      It has blogs, tips, code snippets and  Problem-Solution.

      Most importantly, they are all practical + battle tested stuffs which we regularly use on production application.

      Objective of this platform is to help other fellow developers grow with us. And to get reviews from other experts on the way we code.
      so, it's a win-win situation.
